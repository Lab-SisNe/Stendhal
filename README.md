# PD_GL_CPP

First version of the implementation of the Potjans and Diesmann Cortical microcircuit (Potjans and Diesmann, 2014)
with a stochastic neuron model (Galves and Locherbach, 2013; Brochini et al., 2016).

## Random number generator

In the code, if the include file pcg-cpp/pcg_random.hpp is present in the source folder,
pcg32 random generator engine will be selected. Otherwise, it will use the standard mt19937.

# How to build

$ cmake source_dir
$ make

# How to execute

$ stendhal_PD seed sim_time <conn_matrix>

conn_matrix is a csv file containing
j, i, w, d

where
j: pre-synaptic neuron index (starts at 1)
i: post-synaptic neuron index (starts at 1)
w: synaptic weight
d: synaptic delay

If conn_matrix is not provided, the connection matrix is generated from the connection
probability matrix

# output files:

connection.txt : generated only when connection is generated by the code (10 lines of header)
spike_recorder.txt : spike activity data (2 lines of header; time, neuron_ID, V_m)
